Here's a simple explanation:\n\nWhen you throw a frisbee or turn a helicopter's rotors, you're creating lift. Lift is the upward force that helps keep the object airborne. Here's why:\n\n1. **Air resistance**: When an object moves through the air, it pushes the air around it. The air resistance creates a force that helps lift the object off the ground.\n2. **Shape**: The shape of the object matters too. A frisbee's curved top and a helicopter's angled blades create a smooth flow of air around them, which helps generate lift.\n3. **Angle**: The angle at which the object moves through the air also plays a role. If the frisbee or helicopter is tilted just right, it can use the air resistance to stay aloft.\n\nSo, when you combine air resistance, shape, and angle, you get lift â€“ and that's what allows objects like frisbees and helicopters to fly!", "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide me one sentence for each of the following: steam, helicopter, frisbee"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A steam rises from the kettle.
