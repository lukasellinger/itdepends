The guitar's body and neck are often crafted from tonewoods like mahogany, spruce, and rosewood, which are prized for their acoustic properties.\n* A firestick, on the other hand, might be made of wood if it's a decorative piece or a toy, but it could also be made from other materials like plastic, metal, or bamboo.
