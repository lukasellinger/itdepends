The shape of the wings also deflects air downward, creating a forward force called thrust, which propels the plane forward.\n2. **Helicopters**: They generate lift by rotating their blades (or rotors) to push air downward.

Their lightweight bodies, thin wings, and powerful muscles allow for this remarkable flight.\n2. **Cheetahs**: While they're not flying, they can sprint at incredible speeds (up to 70 mph) thanks to their slender bodies, long legs, and specialized paw structure. Their \"flight\" is more about rapid acceleration and agility, which allows them to chase prey.\n3. **Bats**: As mammals, they have a unique adaptation: their wings are actually modified forelimbs.
