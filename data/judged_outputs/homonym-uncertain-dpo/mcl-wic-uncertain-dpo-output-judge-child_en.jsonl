Like \"I like ice cream!\" or \"I saw a dog!\"\n\nBut sometimes, we need to say something to make our words sound nicer or to help us think of what to say next. That's where \"filler\" words come in!\n\nFiller words are like little helpers that we use to make our talking or writing sound more natural. They're like little \"ums\" or \"ahs\" that we say when we're thinking about what to say next.\n\nFor example, if you're talking to your friend and you're trying to think of what to say, you might say \"um... like... I think we should... play outside!\" The \"um\" and \"like\" are filler words that help you think of what to say next.\n\nOr, if you're writing a story and you need to think of what to write next, you might write \"and then... and then... the cat chased the mouse!\" The \"and then\" is a filler word that helps you think of what to write next.\n\nSo, filler words are like little helpers that we use to make our talking and writing sound more natural and easy to understand!", "evaluation": {"definitions": ["Words like 'um', 'like', or 'and then' that help us think of what to say next and make our talking or writing sound more natural."], "category": "One", "definition_explanation": "The response defines filler as words that assist in conversation and writing, using kid-friendly examples and metaphors.

Imagine a little plant that needs water and sunshine to grow big and strong. If it doesn't get enough water or sunshine, it might start to wilt and look sad. That's kind of like what \"languishing\" means!\n\nFor example, if a person is feeling sad and not doing well, we might say they're \"languishing\" because they're not feeling happy and strong like they should be. Or, if a project or idea isn't getting the attention it needs, it might start to \"languish\" because it's not growing or getting better.\n\nSo, \"languishing\" is like when something or someone isn't getting the help or care they need to be happy and strong!", "evaluation": {"definitions": ["Not doing well or growing strong, like a plant that needs water and sunshine", "Feeling sad and not doing well, like a person who isn't happy and strong", "A project or idea that isn't getting the attention it needs to grow or improve"], "category": "Multiple", "definition_explanation": "The response provides three distinct meanings of 'languish': one related to plants, one to personal feelings, and one to projects or ideas.

It means to get away from something that's not fun or safe, and go somewhere else that is.\n\nFor example, if you're playing a game and you don't like it anymore, you might \"escape\" by running away to play with something else. Or, if you're playing outside and it starts raining, you might \"escape\" by running back inside to stay dry.\n\nFor animals, \"escape\" might mean getting away from something scary, like a big dog or a loud noise.

It bursts and makes a loud noise! That's kind of like a \"bang\". Or, if you throw a ball really hard against the ground, it might make a \"bang\" sound too!\n\nBut sometimes, when we talk about \"bang\", we're talking about something that happens in the sky, like a firework exploding or a big rocket blasting off.

We might go to a special place, like a camp or a quiet house, where we can relax, think, and recharge.\n\nWe might do things like meditate, read books, or take long walks. We might even have yummy food and drinks to help us feel happy and relaxed.
