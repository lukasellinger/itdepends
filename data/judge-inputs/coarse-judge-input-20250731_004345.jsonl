These particles vibrate and collide with each other, releasing heat energy.\n* On a larger scale, the Earth's surface can be hot due to the sun's energy. The sun's rays warm the ground, air, and objects, making them hot.\n* In general, when particles or objects move quickly or collide, they can release heat energy, making things hot.\n\nIf you're asking about something specific, please clarify!"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "ResponseCategory", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"explanation": {"type": "string"}, "category": {"type": "string", "enum": ["refuse", "missing", "answer_attempt", "hedge", "clarification"]}}, "required": ["explanation", "category"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}
