However, it's not as agile or efficient in flight as many other birds, and its wings are relatively small compared to its body size.\n\nOne reason for this is that the hoatzin has a number of specialized adaptations that are thought to be related to its diet and habitat. For example, its claws are zygodactylous, meaning that two toes point forward and two backward, which is useful for grasping onto branches and leaves. Its wings are also relatively stiff and broad, which may be more suited to short, fluttering flights than long-distance soaring.\n\nDespite these limitations, the hoatzin is still able to fly, and it's thought to be an important adaptation for its survival in its native rainforest habitat."}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "ResponseCategory", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"explanation": {"type": "string"}, "category": {"type": "string", "enum": ["refuse", "missing", "answer_attempt", "hedge", "clarification"]}}, "required": ["explanation", "category"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Les koalas sont des herbivores qui se nourrissent principalement de feuilles de eucalyptus, qui sont très fibreuses et difficiles à digérer. Pour compenser cela, leur système digestif est très long et complexe, ce qui leur permet de digérer ces feuilles avec efficacité. Cependant, cela signifie également que les koalas ont besoin de beaucoup de calories pour fonctionner, et les arbres leur offrent un abri et un accès à une source de nourriture abondante.\n\nEnfin, les koalas ont également une très bonne vue et une excellente sensibilité au toucher, ce qui leur permet de se déplacer avec précision dans les arbres et de trouver des branches pour se reposer ou se nourrir."}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "ResponseCategory", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"explanation": {"type": "string"}, "category": {"type": "string", "enum": ["refuse", "missing", "answer_attempt", "hedge", "clarification"]}}, "required": ["explanation", "category"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

This vibration creates the sound we hear.\n* Wood is a good resonator: The wood of the guitar body helps to amplify and shape the sound of the strings. It's like a big speaker that helps to make the sound louder and clearer.\n* Wood is a good material for shaping: Wood is easy to carve and shape, which makes it a good choice for creating the curves and contours of a guitar.\n\nOverall, wood is a great material for making guitars because it helps to create a good sound and a comfortable playing experience."}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "ResponseCategory", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"explanation": {"type": "string"}, "category": {"type": "string", "enum": ["refuse", "missing", "answer_attempt", "hedge", "clarification"]}}, "required": ["explanation", "category"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}
