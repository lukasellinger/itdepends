{"answer": "Thunder is loud because it is the result of a rapid expansion of air caused by the intense heat of a lightning bolt. When lightning strikes, it heats the surrounding air to an extremely high temperature—up to 30,000°C (54,000°F)—in a fraction of a second. This sudden heating causes the air to expand explosively, creating a shock wave that propagates as a sound wave, which we hear as thunder. The loudness depends on factors like the distance from the lightning strike, the intensity of the lightning, and atmospheric conditions.", "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide me one sentence for each of the following: firestick, explosion, thunder"}, {"role": "system", "content": "A firestick can be used as a decorative piece in the garden.
