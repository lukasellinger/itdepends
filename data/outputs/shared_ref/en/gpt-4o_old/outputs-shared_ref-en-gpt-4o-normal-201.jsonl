{"answer": "Each of the phenomena you mentioned—firestick, explosion, and thunder—can be associated with loud sounds due to different reasons:\n\n1. **Firestick**: Although not typically loud, if you're referring to a firework in the shape of a stick or a similar incendiary device, it can be loud due to the rapid combustion of chemicals that create a burst of sound and light.\n\n2. **Explosion**: An explosion is loud because it involves a rapid release of energy, creating high-pressure waves that travel through the air as sound. The sudden expansion of gases and the shockwave contribute to its loudness.\n\n3. **Thunder**: Thunder is loud because it is the sound resulting from the rapid expansion of air surrounding a lightning bolt.
