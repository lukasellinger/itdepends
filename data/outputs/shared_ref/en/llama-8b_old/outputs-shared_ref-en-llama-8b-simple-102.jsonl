{"answer": "Here are simple explanations for why each of the things I mentioned is hot:\n\n* Lava is hot because it's molten rock that comes from deep inside the Earth. The Earth's heat melts the rock, making it liquid and very hot.\n* Steam is hot because it's water that's been heated to its boiling point. When water gets hot enough, it turns into steam, which is made up of tiny water particles moving quickly and carrying a lot of heat energy.\n* A dog is not necessarily hot, but its body temperature is usually around 100°F (38°C), which is warmer than the air around it.

{"answer": "It's hot because of the way the lava and flame work.\n\nLava is hot because it's melted rock from inside the Earth.
