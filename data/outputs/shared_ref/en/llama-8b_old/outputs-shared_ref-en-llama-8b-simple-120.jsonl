{"answer": "Bats, birds like owls, and some other animals can fly because of special features on their bodies. Here's a simple explanation:\n\n*   Bats have **wings** made of skin and bones that stretch from their body to their long fingers. When they flap their wings, they create lift, which helps them rise into the air.\n*   Birds, including owls, have **feathers** that help them fly. The shape of their wings and the way they move their wings creates lift, allowing them to soar through the air.\n*   Both bats and birds also have **lightweight bones** that help them fly. This means their bones are made of a special material that's not too heavy, making it easier for them to lift off the ground and stay airborne.\n\nThese special features work together to help bats and birds fly through the air.", "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide me one sentence for each of the following: bat, raccoon, owl"}, {"role": "system", "content": "A bat hung quietly from the cave ceiling.
