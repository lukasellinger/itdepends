{"answer": "Sure! Here's a simple explanation for each:  \n\n1. **Helicopter**: It can fly because its spinning blades push air downward, creating an upward force called lift. The blades are shaped like wings and angled to push air efficiently, letting the helicopter rise and hover.  \n\n2. **Frisbee**: It can fly because of its curved shape and how it‚Äôs thrown. The curved top and flat bottom create lift as air moves faster over the top than the bottom. Spinning it (like a gyro) also helps it stay stable in the air.  \n\nLet me know if you meant one specific object! üòä", "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide me one sentence for each of the following: steam, helicopter, frisbee"}, {"role": "system", "content": "A steam rises from the kettle.
