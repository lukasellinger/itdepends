{"answer": "- **Whale**: Whales can swim due to their streamlined bodies, powerful tail flukes, and lung capacity for diving.  \n- **Shark**: Sharks swim using their muscular tails and specialized fins, aided by their cartilaginous skeletons for agility.  \n- **Coffee**: Coffee (as a liquid) doesn’t \"swim,\" but it flows due to gravity and fluid dynamics.  \n\nIf you meant one of these specifically, clarify further! 😊", "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide me one sentence for each of the following: whale, coffee, shark"}, {"role": "system", "content": "A whale is a large marine mammal.
