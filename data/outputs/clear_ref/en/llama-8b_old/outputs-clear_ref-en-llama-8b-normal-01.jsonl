However, it's not as agile or efficient in flight as many other birds, and its wings are relatively small compared to its body size.\n\nOne reason for this is that the hoatzin has a number of specialized adaptations that are thought to be related to its diet and habitat. For example, its claws are zygodactylous, meaning that two toes point forward and two backward, which is useful for grasping onto branches and leaves. Its wings are also relatively stiff and broad, which may be more suited to short, fluttering flights than long-distance soaring.\n\nDespite these limitations, the hoatzin is still able to fly, and it's thought to be an important adaptation for its survival in its native rainforest habitat.", "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide me one sentence for each of the following: hoatzin, dog"}, {"role": "system", "content": "An hoatzin is a bird native to South America.
